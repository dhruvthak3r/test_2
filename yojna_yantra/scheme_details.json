        "eligibility": "Eligibility\nThe universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).\nCriteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion - \n1. Households without shelter\n2. Destitute/ living on alms\n3. Manual scavengers\n4. Primitive Tribal Groups\n5. Legally released bonded laborer\nPrioritisation within the Universe\ni.  There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. \nii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. \niii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. \nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\ni. Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\nii. Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\niii. Households with no literate adult above 25 years\niv. Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\nv. Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\nvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\nNote: To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.\nEarmarking of Targets - \nFor SC/ST:\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\nFor Minorities:\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\nFor PwDs:\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\nTie Breaker\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\ni. Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\nii. Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\niii. Households with a single girl child.\niv.

        "benefits": "Benefits\nFixation of credit limit/Loan amount\nThe short-term limit to arrive for the first year: For farmers raising a single crop in a year: Scale of finance for the crop (as decided by District Level Technical Committee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10% of limit towards post-harvest / household/consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs and maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance, PAIS & asset insurance.\nLimit for second & subsequent year: First-year limit for crop cultivation purposes arrived at as above plus 10% of the limit towards cost escalation/increase in the scale of finance for every successive year ( 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year) and estimated Term loan component for the tenure of Kisan Credit Card, i.e., five years.\nFor farmers raising more than one crop in a year, the limit is to be fixed as above depending upon the crops cultivated as per the proposed cropping pattern for the first year and an additional 10% of the limit towards cost escalation/increase in the scale of finance for every successive year (2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th year). It is assumed that the farmer adopts the same cropping pattern for the remaining four years also. In case the cropping pattern adopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be reworked. \nTerm loans for investments towards land development, minor irrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum of credit for the term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank’s judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.\nThe long-term loan limit is based on the proposed investments during the five-year period and the bank’s perception of the repaying capacity of the farmer \nMaximum Permissible Limit: The short-term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long-term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and treated as the Kisan Credit Card Limit.\nFixation of Sub-limits for other than Marginal Farmers: \nShort-term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. Besides, at present, short-term crop loans are covered under Interest Subvention Scheme/ Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme. Further, repayment schedules and norms are different for short-term and term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting convenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub-limits for short-term cash credit limit cum savings account and term loans. \nThe drawing limit for short-term cash credit should be fixed based on the cropping pattern and the amounts for crop production, repairs and maintenance of farm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn at the convenience of the farmer. In case the revision of the scale of finance for any year by the district-level committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five-year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed and the farmer is advised about the same. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. For term loans, instalments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of the investment and the repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point in time, the total liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year. \nWherever the card limit/liability so arrived warrants additional security, the banks may take suitable collateral as per their policy.",

        "details": "Details\nThe Scheme “Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging Fellows/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.\n    With a view to infuse fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these Fellows/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\nNodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):\nThe Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1. Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries\n2. Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Fellowship\n3. Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology\n4. Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\nScope of the Scheme:\nThe scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Fellows of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Fellows will be attached/anchored to that institution.\nDuration of the Fellowship:\nThe duration of the Fellowship will be for a maximum period of two years.\nIn exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the fellow won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.\nThe award of the Fellowship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.\nNumber of Fellowships:\nThe scheme envisages the granting of up to 15 Fellowships in a year.\nEach nodal institution can be awarded 1 Fellowship in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.\nAdministration of the Scheme:\nThe total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants. ",
        "benefits": "Benefits\nHonorarium:\nA Tagore National Fellow who is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government setup in India would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization. Essential or mandatory contributions of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations as would have been paid by them had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.\nA Fellow from abroad or from a set-up other than University, College, Research Institute or Government service, or who has retired from active service and/or is on pension, would be entitled to a fixed honorarium of ₹80,000/- per month.\nNo payment of honorarium would normally be made to a Fellow receiving full funding from other sources up to the level of the honorarium, but such Fellow will, however, receive a Contingency Grant, other allowances, and facilities, as decided by the NSC.  \nContingency Grant:\nIn case of foreign and Indian research fellows residing or serving abroad and having been selected as Tagore Fellows under Non-MoC institutions, to and fro economy class airfare from their country of residence will be provided/reimbursed by the Ministry once during the course of the Fellowship.\nSimilarly, all fellows under Non-MoC institutions who take up the Fellowship under the Scheme will be reimbursed, on an ‘actual’ basis, contingent expenses for making academic trips, engaging research assistants, etc. up to a maximum ceiling of ₹2.50 lakhs per annum, during the tenure of Fellowship subject to verification of requisite bills by the Nodal Institutions.\nNote: For Fellows selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\nAccommodation:\nA Fellow who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Fellowship.\nThe selected Fellow will be entitled to receive a House Rent Allowance of up to 30% of the honorarium. However, with respect to Fellows from Universities, colleges, Research institutes, or Government setups HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.\nThe MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\nIn respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Fellows on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement.\nSettling Allowance:\nA Fellow from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of ₹1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of Fellowship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.\nAllowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Fellowship for moving out of station. On a case-to-case basis, economy airfare from his/her place/country of residence will be provided/reimbursed upon joining and at the conclusion of the Fellowship. In this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.\nSupport to Fellows:\nInfrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Fellows to enable them to conduct their research. This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution’s premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.\nOne important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Fellows to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign fellows engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.\nEncouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Fellows to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an ‘actuals’ basis, with a ceiling of ₹1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged",
        "eligibility": "Eligibility\nFellows who have sound academic or professional credentials and have made significant contributions to knowledge in their respective fields will be eligible to apply for Tagore National Fellowship.\nPreferably the Fellows who have 5 years of experience in conducting/guiding research or the same experience in performing/any other arts can apply for Tagore National Fellowship.\nThe applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit, at least two monographs (single-authored).\nFellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph, as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the Nodal Institution.\nThose who have in the past directly engaged with major projects at the Nodal Institution and fulfilled the above-mentioned eligibility criteria for a Tagore Fellow are encouraged to apply for the Tagore National Fellowship.\nOnce awarded a Tagore National Fellowship, a candidate cannot apply again for a Fellowship under this scheme, either at the same or any other institution covered under the Scheme.\nThe Scheme will be open to both Indian and foreign nationals. However, the proportion of foreigners will not normally exceed one–third of the total fellowships awarded in a year.\nNote 01: Interested Fellows are required to enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in Appendix A.\nNote 02: Fellows are also required to prepare a short write-up on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.\nNote 03: The honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order; the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) of the sponsoring institution and the National Selection Committee may keep these in mind while recommending/ selecting the Tagore National Fellows.\nNote 04: In short, a person selected for the Tagore National Fellowship should be one who has already become a ‘legend’ in his area of work or is regarded very highly. It is appropriate that those who do not come near this description may not apply or be considered for the highest honour and honorarium accorded to a Fellow in India under this Fellowship.\nAreas of Research and Eligible Projects:\nThe selected Fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.\nIf the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.\nSince the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.\nAt the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.

        "url": "https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnscr",
        "details": "Details\nThe Scheme “Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging scholars/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.\n    With a view to infusing fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these scholars/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\nNodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):\nThe Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Scholars to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1. Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries\n2. Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Scholarship\n3. Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology\n4. Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\nScope of the Scheme:\nThe scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Scholars of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Scholars will be attached/anchored to that institution.\nDuration of the Scholarship:\nThe duration of the Tagore Scholarship is up to 2 years.\nIn exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the Scholar won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.\nThe award of the Scholarship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.\nNumber of Scholarships:\nThe scheme envisages the granting of up to 25 Scholarships in a year.\nEach nodal institution can be awarded 1 Scholarship or a maximum of 2 scholarships in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.\nAdministration of the Scheme:\nThe total number of Scholarships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Scholars to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Scholars, through outsourcing or Consultants. ",
        "benefits": "Benefits\nHonorarium:\nThe scholarship honorarium will be ₹50,000/- per month. However, if the scholar is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government set-up in India, he/she would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.\nNote: Essential or mandatory contribution of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.  \nContingency Grant:\nIn case of scholars selected as Tagore Scholars under Non-MoC institutions, will also be paid a contingency grant by the Ministry on an ‘actuals basis’ up to a maximum ceiling of ₹10,000 per month and such other allowances/benefits provided in this scheme, and to the extent, as may be specifically decided in each case by the ILSCC/NSC (within the limits applicable in the case of Tagore National Fellows), depending on the nature and the duration of the project subject to the verification of the bills by the Nodal Institutions.\nNote: For scholars selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\nAccommodation:\nA Scholar who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Scholarship.\nThe selected Scholar will be entitled to receive a House Rent Allowance of up to 30% of the honorarium. However, with respect to Scholars from University, College, Research Institute or Government set up, HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.\nMoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\nIn respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Scholars on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement. \nSettling Allowance:\nA Scholar from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of ₹1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of the Scholarship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.\nAllowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Scholarship for moving out of station. On a case-to-case basis, economy airfare from his/her place/country of residence will be provided/reimbursed upon joining and on the conclusion of the Scholarship.\nIn this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.\nIntimation in advance is also required to be given to the Ministry by the Non-MoC Institutions. MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry. \nSupport to Scholars:\nInfrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Scholars to enable them to conduct their research. This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution’s premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.\nOne important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Scholars to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign Scholars engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.\nEncouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Scholars to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an ‘actuals’ basis, with a ceiling of ₹1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged.",
        "eligibility": "Eligibility\nA scholar with good academic credentials at least one publication, either a book or a research paper in reputed journals, and 2 years of research/teaching experience will be eligible to apply for the Tagore National Scholarships.\nThis scheme also gives opportunities to young artists/performers to apply for the scholarship.\nThe scholars also need to identify a nodal institution from the list given in Appendix B according to their preferences/expertise to conduct original research preferably by using the sources of the same institution. The research work may also include the identification and cataloging of sources available with the institution or the archiving and creation of new sources that the institution should have. (Guidelines for preparing research proposal are given in Appendix A)\nAreas of Research and Eligible Projects:\nThe selected Scholars will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.\nIf the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Scholar otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship would recommend the Scholars to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Scholars, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.\nSince the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.\nAt the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.",
        "application_process": "Application Process\nOffline\nApplication Process:\nStep 01: The Ministry of Culture and/or the concerned institution will widely advertise the Scholarship in the leading national/regional newspapers and on its website (which should give all details) and also disseminate the scheme through professional associations/forums in the relevant fields, so that maximum publicity is accorded to the Scheme.\nStep 02: Eligible Scholars who can spare time of about two years to do a project based on the resources of any of the participating institutions can only apply during the prescribed timeline mentioned in the advertisement.\nStep 03: The candidates may submit their application form, prepared according to the prescribed guidelines of the Scheme, to any one of the Nodal Institutions of his/her choice depending upon the area of research proposed to be undertaken.\nStep 04: Candidates may submit their application form along with a biocatalyst of publications and other relevant documents including a write-up on the proposed work (guidelines are in Appendix A), the applicant should enclose a declaration stating that if selected for the Scholarship, he/she will complete the tenure of the Scholarship.\nNote: The list of nodal institutions along with the other relevant details of the Scheme and application form is available on the website of the Ministry of Culture and Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML) (erstwhile Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) under the Scheme Head of the website.\nProcess of Selection:\nStep 01: The received applications will be examined by the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) constituted by each participating institution for the purposes of this scheme.\nStep 02: The applications found worthy of consideration will be shortlisted by the ILSSC.\nStep 03: The selection will be based on the relevance of the study, the benefits of the nodal institution from that particular study, and the credentials and reputation of the scholar. Only such proposals may be selected\nthat seek to (a) engage Scholars who have achieved national or international recognition and proven acceptance of their work in national/ international circles; (b) bring out resources that are not yet fully out in the public domain; and (c) publish the work for the benefit of the concerned institution. The selection will be done in two stages.\nStep 04: The first stage will be of shortlisting of projects and candidates by the ILSSC, according to the criteria broadly specified as part of the Search-cum-Screening process. Apart from considering the applications received, the ILSSC is also expected to adopt a proactive approach to identify relevant projects and search for reputed Scholars in that field, contact such Scholars, and encourage them to submit their proposals.

The course curricula have been restructured to develop much-needed skills and entrepreneurial mindset among the graduates to take up self-employment, contribute to the enhanced rural livelihood and food security, sustainability of agriculture, and be propeller for agricultural transformation.\n\nThe following components are proposed for carrying out one year Student READY program in all the Undergraduate (UG) disciplines\nExperiential Learning on Business Model / Hands-on Training\nExperiential Learning on Skill Development. \nRural Awareness Works Experience (RAWE).\nInternship / In-Plant Training / Industrial attachment\nStudents Projects\n\nStudent READY program is introduced in fourth year of undergraduate education in the following subjects:\nAgriculture\nAgriculture Engineering\nBio-Technology\nDairy Technology\nFisheries\nFood Technology\nForestry\nHorticulture\nHome Science (now Community Science)\nSericulture\n\nFive components of student READY are:\nExperiential Learning with business mode.\nHands-on training (HOT)/ Skill development training i.e. Experiential Learning without business mode.\nRural Awareness Work Experience (RAWE).\nInternship/In-Plant Training/ Industrial attachment.\nStudents Projects.\n\nExperiential Learning with business mode\nExperiential Learning (EL) with business mode helps the student to develop competence, capability, capacity building, acquiring skills, expertise, and confidence to start their own enterprise and turn job creators instead of job seekers.  This is a step forward for “Earn while Learn” concept. Experiential Learning is an important module for high quality professional competence and practical work experience in real life situation to Graduates. The module with entrepreneurial orientation of production and production to consumption pattern is expected to facilitate producing Job Providers rather than Job Seekers. The EL provides the students an excellent opportunity to develop analytical and entrepreneurial skills, and knowledge through meaningful hands on experience, confidence in their ability to design and execute project work.  The main objectives of EL are:\n\nTo promote professional skills and knowledge through meaningful hands on experience.\nTo build confidence and to work in project mode.\nTo acquire enterprise management capabilities.\n\nRural Agricultural Work Experience (RAWE) \nThe Rural Agricultural Work Experience (RAWE) provides exposure to agricultural students to the natural setting of the village situations, work with the farm families, identify their problems and make use of various extension tools for transferring the latest agricultural technologies. The students also get opportunity to study the various on-going schemes related to agriculture and rural development and participate in their implementation. The students were given rigorous orientation and familiarization on various issues and problems expected on farmers’ field and hence gain competence and confidence for solving problems related to agriculture and allied sciences. It has been implemented in adopted villages under the supervision of scientists. Activities focused on intensive observations/ analysis of socio-economic and technological profile of the farm families in rural areas, participatory extension approach and acquaintance with farming situations, farm practices and interaction with progressive farmers. Soil testing has become the integral part of RAWE. This helps orient our agricultural graduates for participation in various rural developmental programme. The students also gained first hand information on industries during attachment with identified agro based industries.\nThe stipend rates have been enhanced of Rs 3000/ student/ month for a maximum of 6 months for the village/ rural training under student READY programme.\n\nIn Plant Training (IPT)/ Industrial Attachment \nTechnology and globalization are ushering an era of unprecedented change. The need and pressure for change and innovation is immense. To enrich the practical knowledge of the students, in-plant training is mandatory.  In this training, students will have to study a problem in industrial perspective and submit the reports to the university. Such in-plant trainings will provide an industrial exposure to the students as well as to develop their career in the high tech industrial requirements. In-Plant training is meant to correlate theory and actual practices in the industries with the following objectives\nTo expose the students to Industrial environment, this cannot be simulated in the university.\nTo familiarize the students with various Materials, Machines, Processes, Products and their applications along with relevant aspects of shop management.\nTo make the students understand the psychology of the workers, and approach to problems along with the practices followed at factory\nTo make the students understand the scope, functions and job responsibility-ties in various departments of an organization.\nExposure to various aspects of entrepreneurship during the program period.\n\nStudents Projects \nThere is number of students interested in higher education and study abroad. Keeping in view their future requirement a component of Student Project is placed to understand and identify problems of his/ her interest and field, experimental set up, taking observation and writing and documentation in the form of thesis. Project work provides several opportunities to students to learn various aspects that cannot be taught in a class room or laboratory. In order to provide such opportunities to the graduates of agricultural science, Students Project is proposed as one of the components of the Student READY. It may be adopted based on the interest of student and expertise and facilities available with the College.The Students Project is proposed with the following objectives: \nTo impart analytical skills and capability to work independently.\nTo conceptualize, design and implement the proposed work plan.\nLearn to work as a team- sharing work amongst a group, and learn leadership\nLearn to solve a problem through all its stages by understanding and applying project management skills.\nLearn to do various implementations, fabrication, testing and trouble shooting.\nLearn communication report writing skills.",

        "url": "https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pahal-dbtl",
        "details": "Details\nPAHAL (DBTL) has been introduced to curb the diversion of subsidized LPG. Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.\n\nBefore PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market. \n\nTo infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.\n\nPAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using \"Form 5\" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC’s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.\n\nThe DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database. \n\nSuch a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further. To confirm this they can either contact their LPG distributor or visit www.mylpg.in and access the individual OMC’s portals. Such consumers will start getting the LPG subsidy directly into their bank account as soon as the scheme is launched in their district. \n\nThose consumers who didn’t join the scheme earlier but have their Aadhaar number with them can join the scheme and become CTC by getting the same seeded with their LPG distributor as well as with their banks. For those who are not yet enrolled with UIDAI and don’t have an Aadhaar number can also join the scheme and become CTC by getting their bank details seeded into the LPG database. \n\nObjectives - \nThe following are the key objectives of the scheme - \na) Remove incentive for diversion. \nb) Protect entitlement and ensure subsidy to the consumer. \nc) Improve the availability/delivery of LPG cylinders for genuine users \nd) Weed out fake/duplicate connections \ne) Allow Self Selection in subsidy ",

It aims to integrate pilgrimage destinations in a prioritised, planned and sustainable manner to provide a complete religious tourism experience. The PRASAD scheme aims to pave the way for the development and promotion of religious tourism in India.",
        "benefits": "Benefits\nThe scheme offers a range of benefits for its beneficiaries, which include local communities, tourists, and stakeholders involved in the tourism sector:\nImproved Infrastructure\nBeneficiaries, particularly those residing in areas with significant tourism potential, benefit from improved infrastructure such as better roads, transportation facilities, sanitation, and utilities. Enhanced infrastructure not only improves the quality of life for locals but also provides a more comfortable and convenient experience for tourists.\nEmployment Opportunities\nThe development of tourism infrastructure and services under the Prashad Scheme creates job opportunities for local residents. These jobs span various sectors, including hospitality, tour guiding, transportation, handicrafts, and retail, providing a source of livelihood and economic empowerment for communities.\nIncome Generation\nTourism-related activities generate income for beneficiaries involved in providing goods and services to tourists. Local artisans, vendors, homestay owners, and small businesses often experience increased demand for their products and services, leading to higher incomes and improved standards of living.\nPreservation of Cultural Heritage\nCommunities living near heritage sites and cultural landmarks benefit from the preservation efforts funded by the Prashad Scheme. This not only helps in maintaining their cultural identity but also provides opportunities for cultural exchange and education, as visitors learn about local traditions, customs, and history.\nPromotion of Local Culture and Traditions\nThe Prashad Scheme often includes initiatives to promote local culture, art, and traditions. This may involve organizing cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and traditional performances, which not only showcase the richness of local heritage but also contribute to community pride and cohesion.\nIncreased Tourism Revenues\nAs tourism flourishes in areas supported by the Prashad Scheme, beneficiaries reap the benefits of increased tourism revenues. This can have a multiplier effect on the local economy, stimulating growth in ancillary sectors such as food and beverage, retail, and transportation.\nSkill Development and Capacity Building\nThe Prashad Scheme may include provisions for skill development and capacity building programs targeted at local communities. These initiatives equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills and knowledge to actively participate in the tourism industry, empowering them to capitalize on tourism opportunities and contribute to sustainable development.",

Also, the cost must not exceed ₹75,000.\n\nConstruction of Common Facility\nThis government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village.

The project focuses on the evidence-based scientific implementation of this plan.\n\nThe project has introduced transformational changes in the agriculture sector by scaling up the adoption of climate-smart technologies and practices at the farm and micro-watershed level, contributing to drought-proofing and creation of new opportunities in villages worst hit by drought and salinity/sodicity affected villages in the state. The project is supporting investments by farmers, farmers’ collectives, and communities for accessing water, optimal utilization of natural resources, value addition of agriculture commodities, and adoption of climate-resilient agriculture technologies. The project has taken a gender-sensitive approach to prioritize the needs of the women stakeholders in the planning and implementation of project interventions which is being driven through “Krushi Tais” (female mobilizers) at the village level.\n\nDirect Benefit Transfer portal and mobile application allow farmers to apply for matching grants for their farm-level investments aimed at improving incomes. The DBT portal is a workflow-based end to end online system through which the project officials can verify the eligibility and assets created and transfer the matching grants directly to the farmer’s Aadhar linked bank account.

        "eligibility": "Eligibility\nOnly Small growers with coffee holding sizes of up to 10 Ha. are eligible.\nApplicable for replantation of existing old/senile and low-productive Arabica and Robusta coffee plantations; aged 25 years in the case of Arabica, 40 years in the case of Robusta and 15 years in the case of Arabica dwarfs by adopting either clean replanting or interlining in the existing blocks.\nIn the case of inter-planting of Arabica in Robusta adopting clean replanting, the subsidy will be given only to Robusta which is the main crop.\nWhen interlined in the old blocks, the old/unproductive plants should preferably be removed after one harvest and under no circumstances beyond two harvests i.e., for instance, if interlining is done in August-September 2017, the old plants should preferably be uprooted after harvesting the standing crop by December 2017 to March 2018 or after harvesting the second crop by December 2018 to March 2019. This would ensure that the newly interlined plants would not suffer too much root competition and receive adequate sunlight for vigorous growth.\nIn Arabica zones with an elevation of 1000 metres above MSL, the old Arabica coffee blocks should be replanted with disease-tolerant, high-yielding Arabica varieties only. In other areas, with an elevation of less than 1000 meters above MSL, which is suitable for both Arabica and Robusta cultivation, the existing Arabica blocks replanted with Robusta material are eligible.\nIn states like Tamil Nadu, if coffee is grown along with intercrops like pepper, orange, banana etc., and the land documents indicate the extent of each crop separately, in such a situation, the subsidy will be based on the actual extent of the area replanted with coffee or based on the maximum extent of land mentioned in the land documents, including other intercrops, whichever is less.\nAs far as possible, the growers should adopt appropriate planting designs that are suitable for the mechanization of farm operations. In the case of estates that adopt such a modified planting design amenable to mechanization, the subsidy will be considered for the entire area of replanting and not based on the plant population.",

        "details": "Details\nDeendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is the flagship program of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions for the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. \n\nNRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.\n\nThe Mission\n\"To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.\"\n\nThe Core Values\nInclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes\nTransparency and accountability of all processes and institutions\nOwnership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages – planning, implementation, and, monitoring\nCommunity self-reliance and self-dependence\n\nNRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables - \n(a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, \n(b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery, \n(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and \n(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. \n\nAs NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios.",
